Regularization does not change the mesh connectivity and the number of elements in the mesh, which leads to benefit of efficiency and ease of output. The three type of regularization provided by PyMem3DG includes constraints on edge length, local triangle area, and local corner angles, adjusted by $K_{se}$, $K_{sl}$ and $K_{st}$, respectively. "

    "\r\n",
    "As you might observe, there are several disadvantages using the method of regularization. The behavior of simulation will depend on the strength of regularization. Local angle penalty is less restrictive and will minimally affect the underlying physics, but the resolution on high curvature region becomes very coarse. We could combine it with penalty on local area and more strongly edge length, but its influence on physics and optimization can not be neglected. In summary, how to find good balance between restriction and flexibility is not obvious. \r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "To resolve the challenges of regularization, PyMem3DG supports adaptive mesh by mesh mutation, including edge flip, edge split and edge collapse. Because of challenges mentioned above, mesh mutation should always be turned on when running complex simulation with large deformation. \r\n",

    "The computational cost involves the time to loop through elements and decide whether conduct mesh mutation, and the subsequent overheads needed for recomputation of cached quantities. Such operation happens in the frequency of data output, therefore increasing the number of data output could better prevent the deterioration of mesh, but will increase computation.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Because of the varying mesh sizes, instead of single trajectory file using high performance *NetCDF* file, output file consists of series of snapshots in $\\texttt{.ply}$ format. The detail of output files and visualization will be covered in the other tutorial. "

    "Similarly, in theory we could also support specifying additional reference mesh. However, it is only necessary if the current input mesh has large deviation in total surface area from the reference mesh. Since membrane is nearly unstretchable, normally total surface area remains and self-referencing is sufficient. At the time of writing the tutorial, PyMem3DG will throw run-time error when the topology of reference mesh does not agree with the input mesh.\r\n",
