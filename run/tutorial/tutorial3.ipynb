In previous tutorials, we only simulate closed membrane and therefore no addditional complexity on the boundary. Though in reality, lipid membrane is almost always closed, it is beneficial to only simulate certain region of the membrane to save computational cost. \n",

    "### Reference mesh\n",
    "The reasoning on specifying reference mesh remain the same on open boundary mesh vs close surface mesh. In most cases, self referencing is sufficient. One notable difference between close mesh and open mesh is the reference area, which will remain as long as boundary position is fixed (a.k.a fixed and pin boundary). Additional reference mesh may be needed when doing roller boundary condition when for example, continuing an interrupted simulation. \n",
    "### Constant osmotic pressure & surface tension \n",
    "Instead of following the argument of having a membrane reservoir, maybe it is more explicit to specify the surface tension and pressure directly! This is particularly true when membrane reservoir is so large that local deformation is too unnoticeable that approximately it is just applying some constant value of pressure and tension. To do this explicitly, all you need to do is toggle two switches. And $K_V$ and $K_{sg}$ represents pressure and tension directly instead of modulus. In other words,"
