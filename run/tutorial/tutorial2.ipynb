    "The first strategy is to regularize the mesh, restricting the tangential movement of vertices. Regularization does not change the mesh connectivity and the number of elements in the mesh, which leads to benefit of efficiency and ease of output. The three type of regularization provided by PyMem3DG includes constraints on edge length, local triangle area, and local corner angles, adjusted by $K_{se}$, $K_{sl}$ and $K_{st}$, respectively. "

In summary, how to find good balance between restriction and flexibility is not obvious. \n",

    "### Reference mesh when mutation\n",
    "Similarly, in theory we could also support specifying additional reference mesh. However, it is only necessary if the current input mesh has large deviation in total surface area from the reference mesh. Since membrane is nearly unstretchable, normally total surface area remains and self-referencing is sufficient. At the time of writing the tutorial, PyMem3DG will throw run-time error when the topology of reference mesh does not agree with the input mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization + mutation\n",
    "PyMem3DG does not recommend using regularization in conjunction with mesh mutation because it is most likely unnecessary to do so (as we see in previous example, vertex shift somewhat fills the role of regularization) and the behavior is not fully tested."
